# Douban-WordCloud
A Python Script to crawl movie review data from movie.douban.com. It will first get rid of the stopwords, and then calculate the word frequency in the reviews. Final it will generate a wordcloud where words with higher frequency appear larger and words with less frequency look smaller.
